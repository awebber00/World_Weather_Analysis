# World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview of Project
My colleague Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app as do the beta testers. As with any new product, theyâ€™ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data that I have already retrieved. I made a variety of tools to assist travelers on their vacations and trips around the world. For this project I utilized the Google Maps Directions API in an attempt to create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### Project Purpose & Background
The purpose of this report is to analyze world weather as well as create a tool that assists travelers on their vacations and their trips all over the world.
