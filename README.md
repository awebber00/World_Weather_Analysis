# World Weather Analysis

### Overview of Project
My colleague Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app as do the beta testers. As with any new product, theyâ€™ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data that I have already retrieved. I made a variety of tools to assist travelers on their vacations and trips around the world. For this project I utilized the Google Maps Directions API in an attempt to create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### Project Purpose & Background
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize various world weather conditions and place them in data frames as well as create tools that assist travelers on their vacations and their trips all over the world.
